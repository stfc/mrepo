### Disclaimer
This is a trimmed down version of Dag Wieers original TODO list.

### Back-end support
+ Add libcurl support and (optionally?) make it the default 
+ NFS support enable by default, using autofs (waiting for Serge Sterckx)
+ Add support for SRPM files (just put them into one directory /SRPMS)
+ Check files that do not match the regexp and compare filename to rpm headers
+ Use mirrorlist option from .repo files as a source (for http)
+ Autocreate yum .repo files and apt .list files to be used by local clients
+ Add support for other remote synchronising tools (sitecopy, wget)

### Repository metadata
+ Create anaconda-style metadata for booting an updated installation
+ Complain when a required tool is not available
+ Add URPMI and Red Carpet support (help needed)
+ Update Apt release info transparantly when mrepo config changes (Tom G. Christensen)

### Reporting utility
+ Logwatch configuration for mrepo

### Configuration
+ Allow to specify rsync/lftp options on a per distribution basis (see ~/.lftp/rc)
+ Add more working distributions to /etc/mrepo.conf.d/

### Usability
+ Add selinux support

### Documentation
+ Add a mrepo and mrepo.conf manpage
+ Add documentation on how to configure clients
+ Add documentation about chaining mrepo servers
+ Comment the code more (pydoc strings)
+ ZeroConf support (or documentation)
+ Comply with PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

### Internal python
+ Improve the copy/symlink/rename functions, using exceptions
+ Mirroring code should be in a separate class
+ File-operations may need to go to a separate class, use shutil ? (needs python 2.3)
+ Improve the remove and symlink stage (combine the check of existing links with creating and removing)

### Bugs
+ Correct file permissions/ownerships of packages in /var/mrepo (add umask option)

### mrepocfg tool / generate a configuration for clients (Chandan Dutta Chowdhury)
+ The tool should accept a URL as an argument
+ Should have a list (-l) option to list the different distributions
+ Should have a target (-t) option to specify the configuration output format (apt/yum/smart)
+ It scans the URL given and looks for know repository metadata

### mrepousb tool
+ Create a bootable USB stick and allow for 3rd party boot-images
