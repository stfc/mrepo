mrepo builds a local RPM repository from downloaded updates and extra packages from 3rd party repositories.
It takes care of downloading packages and generating metadata

Packages can be download by various means using ftp, http, rsync, reposync or sftp.

This fork of mrepo is only designed to support the running of mirror servers.

For updating your local systems, configure either yum, dnf or apt and point them to your local mrepo server.
